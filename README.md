#### Abstract
Planetary nebulae (PNe) consist of an ionized envelope surrounding
                a hot central star (CSPN) that emits mostly at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths.
                Ultraviolet observations, therefore, provide important information on both the CSPN and the nebula.
                We have matched the PNe in The Hong Kong/AAO/Strasbourg
                Hα (HASH) catalog with the <em>Galaxy Evolution Explorer</em>
                (GALEX) UV sky surveys, the <em>Sloan Digital Sky Survey</em> data
                release 16 (SDSS), and the <em>Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid
                    Response System</em> (Pan-STARRS) PS1 second release.
                A total of 671 PNe were observed by GALEX with the far-UV
                (FUV; 1344-1786Å) and/or the near-UV (NUV; 1771-2831Å)
                detector on (GUVPNcat); 83 were observed by SDSS (PNcatxSDSSDR16)
                and 1819 by Pan-STARRS (PNcatxPS1MDS). We merged a distilled version of these matched catalogs into
                GUVPNcatxSDSSDR16xPS1MDS, which contains a total of 375 PNe with
                both UV and optical photometry over a total spectral coverage of ∼1540-9610Å.
                We analyzed separately 170 PNe resolved in GALEX images and
                determined their UV radius by applying a flux profile analysis.
                The CSPN flux could be extracted separately from the PN emission
                for 8 and 50 objects with SDSS and Pan-STARRS counterparts respectively.
                The multiband photometry was used to distinguish between
                compact and extended PNe and CSPNe (binary CSPNe) by
                color--color diagram analysis. We found that compact PNe candidates
                could be identified by using the $r-i < -0.4$ and $-1 < FUV - NUV < 1$ colors, whereas binary
                    CSPNe candidates in given $T_\mathrm{eff}$ ranges (all with color $r-i> -0.4$ ) can be
                    identified in
                    the
                    color region $(FUV-NUV) \leq 6(r-i)+1.3$, $-0.8 < FUV-NUV < 0.4$ and $r-i < 0.75$.
